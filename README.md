### The poem I chose Is called Love is like a delicate flower, and it is by Ben Littlechild. It is a simple yet beautiful poem that I enjoy. My favorite types of poems is when they Incorporate nature, so this was the perfect poem for me to choose! 

### The background image I used is by Annie Spratt on Splash.com so it is a free image to use, and the butterfly is a photo I took! :)
