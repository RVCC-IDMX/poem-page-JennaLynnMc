<h1>A Poem</h1>

</header>


<p1>Come away, elves!—while the dew is sweet,
    Come to the dingles where fairies meet!
    Know that the lilies have spread their bells
    O’er all the pools in our forest dells;
    Stilly and lightly their vases rest
    On the quivering sleep of the water’s breast,
    Catching the sunshine through leaves that throw
    To their scented bosoms an emerald glow;
    And a star from the depth of each pearly cup,
    A golden star unto heaven looks up,
    As if seeking its kindred where bright they lie,
    Set in the blue of the summer sky.
    Come away! Under arching boughs we’ll float,
    Making those urns each a fairy boat;
    We’ll row them with reeds o’er the fountains free,
    And a tall flag-leaf shall our streamer be;
    And we’ll send out wild music so sweet and low,
    It shall seem from the bright flower’s heart to flow,
    As if ’twere a breeze with a flute’s low sigh,
    Or water-drops train’d into melody.
    Come away! for the midsummer sun grows strong,
    And the life of the lily may not be long.</p1>
